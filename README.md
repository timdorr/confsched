Colony PHP Framework
====================

Colony is a very lightweight, minimalist MVC framework for PHP. It is designed to be extensible and customizable for a variety of environments, but primary development is focused on a view layer backed by [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net) and model layer backed by [Propel](http://www.propelorm.org).

Speed is the primary focus of the project, both when it comes to runtime execution and application development. The framework sets up a development pattern and then gets out of your way. As a result, it is very small in size and adds very little overhead to execution. 

Formerly known as ASOworx.
